# Tesla Revamp

This is a company revamp of a real company, Tesla. This project will only include 4 products from the tesla store page.
The 4 products will be the Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y.
There will also be an account login and signup feature. However, it is not fully implemented.

## Design Process
This website is intended to people who intend to purchase a tesla car.

1. I want to go to the shop page to order a car
2. I want to create an account so I can log in
3. I want to log in so that I can order a car
4. I want to customise my car that I am ordering
5. I want to pay for my car using a credit card
